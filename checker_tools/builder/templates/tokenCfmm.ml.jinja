(* The general concept of cfmm is that you have quantity a of an asset A
 * and b of an asset B and you process buy and sell requests by maintaining
 * the product a * b constant. So if someone wants to sell a quantity da of
 * asset A to the contract, the balance would become (a + da) so you can
 * give that person a quantity db of asset B in exchange such that (a +
 * da)(b - db) = a * b. Solving for db gives db  = da * b / (a + da). We
 * can rewrite this as db = da * (b / a) * (a / (a + da)) where (b / a)
 * represents the  "price" before the order and a / (a + da)  represents
 * the "slippage". Indeed, a property of cfmm is that with arbitrageurs
 * around, the ratio (a / b) gives you the market price of A in terms of B.
 *
 * On top of that, we can add some fees of 0.2 cNp. So the equation becomes
 * something like db = da * b / (a + da) * (1 - 0.2/100) (note that this
 * formula is a first-order approximation in the sense that two orders of size
 * da / 2 will give you a better price than one order of size da, but the
 * difference is far smaller than typical fees or any amount we care about.

(* Functions for the isoutility curve (x + y)^8 - (x - y)^8 = k *)

(* TODO: Some concerns/thoughts:
 * - Do things still work out if the scaling factors change?
 * - What about units of measure? Currently I'm thinking of it this way:
 *     _kit    : kit  / kit_sf    (kit)
 *     _ctok   : ctok / ctok_sf   (ctok)
 *     _dkit   : kit  / kit_sf    (kit)
 *     _target : target / fp_sf   (kit/ctok)
 * - Would it be worth it unrolling the recursion (n=4, always) to lower gas costs?
 * - We should probably move the functions that are tracking_type-independent
 *   into a separate OCaml module that is not generated at build time.
 * - newton_param uses very short names that are easily overlappable. Check
 *   whether this can cause trouble.
 * - Are the claims in the comments correct? Are they correct for Checker
 *   specifically?
