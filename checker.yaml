# Checker system constants
constants:
  # ====================================================================================
  # General constants
  # ====================================================================================
  # [percent] - Yearly burrow fee percentage
  burrow_fee_percentage: 5/1000
  # [percent] - Percentage kept by the cfmm contract from the return asset
  cfmm_fee: 2/1000
  # [tok] - Number of collateral tokens to be given for the creation of a burrow.
  #   Does NOT count towards the burrow's collateral balance.
  creation_deposit: 1_000_000
  # [dimensionless] - Factor used for setting the liquidation limit
  fliquidation: 19/10
  # [dimensionless] - Factor used for setting the minting limit
  fminting: 21/10
  # [dimensionless?] - Maximum yearly imbalance rate
  imbalance_limit: 5/100
  # [dimensionless] - Factor used to scale down the imbalance rate. The higher the value, the
  #   faster the imbalance rate saturates.
  imbalance_scaling_factor: 3/4
  # [percent] - The percentage of additional collateral that we charge when liquidating a burrow
  #   in order to penalize it for liquidation
  liquidation_penalty: 1/10
  # [percent] - The percentage of a burrow's collateral that we offer to whoever triggers
  #   the burrow's liquidation
  liquidation_reward_percentage: 1/1000
  # [cNp/s] - Protected index epsilon. The higher this value is, the faster the protected
  #   index catches up with the actual index. Currently calculated as 0.05cNp
  #   per minute. Basically {[(0.05 / 100) / 60 = 5/600_000 = 1/120_000]}
  #   so the inverse is simply 120_000.
  protected_index_inverse_epsilon: 120_000
  # ====================================================================================
  # Touch constants
  # ====================================================================================
  # The number of liquidation slices to process every time `touch` is called
  number_of_slices_to_process: 5
  # [kit/s] - We want the reward in the first bracket to be 0.1 kit / minute, so we just
  #   divide by 60 to get roughly how much should it be per second.
  #   See {!Checker.calculate_touch_reward} for its use.
  touch_low_reward: 1/600
  # [kit/s] - We want the reward in the second bracket to be 1 kit / minute, so we just
  #   divide by 60 to get roughly how much should it be per second.
  #   See {!Checker.calculate_touch_reward} for its use.
  touch_high_reward: 1/60
  # [s] - Parameter used for calculating the current reward for touching the checker
  #   contract. See {!Checker.calculate_touch_reward} for its use.
  touch_reward_low_bracket: 600
  # ====================================================================================
  # Liquidation auction constants
  # ====================================================================================
  # [nP/s?] - How fast a descending option price drops per second. Currently we want it
  #   to drop by around 1cNp per minute, so we just divide by 60 to get roughly
  #   how much it should be per second.
  auction_decay_rate: 1/6000
  # [nP] - Every bid in an ascending auction needs to improve over the previous bid by
  #  at least 0.33 cNp.
  bid_improvement_factor: 33/10000
  # [blocks] - The maximum number of blocks that can pass between two (ascending) bids
  #   during an auction. The auction should expire if more blocks than this
  #   number pass between two bids.
  max_bid_interval_in_blocks: 20
  # [s] - The maximum number of seconds that can pass between two (ascending) bids
  #   during an auction. The auction should expire if more than this many seconds
  #   pass between two bids. Currently set to 20min ([20min * 60sec/min = 1200s]).
  max_bid_interval_in_seconds: 1200
  # Maximum height of the tree used as liquidation queue.
  #   The maximum number of elements will be between [2**(n-1)] and [2**(n-2)].
  max_liquidation_queue_height: 12
  # [tok] - Maximum amount of collateral tokens which can be in an auction lot
  max_lot_size: 10_000_000_000
  # [dimensionless] The minimum fraction of the auction queue which **must**
  #   go into a new auction lot.
  min_lot_auction_queue_fraction: 5/100
