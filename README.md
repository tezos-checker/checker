# Huxian

* Technical document can be found [here](https://hackmd.io/teMO2x9PRRy1iTBtrSMBvA?view).
* The source code lives in the [src](./src) folder.
* The tests live in the [tests](./tests) folder.
* Documentation, quite underdeveloped at the moment, lives in the [docs](./docs) folder.

## Development

Within a `nix-shell` (the first time this might take a while, since it must fetch all dependencies), type

* `make build-ocaml` to build and compile the ocaml code (in [./src](./src))
* `make generate-ligo` to generate the ligo code (in [./generated/ligo](./generated/ligo))
* `make build-ligo` to generate the michelson code (in [./generated/michelson](./generated/michelson))
* `make build` to do all of the above.
* `make test` to run all the (OCaml) tests ([./src/tests.ml](./src/tests.ml)). (note: this might take a while. If you're in a hurry you might want to comment out `TestAvl.suite` in `tests.ml` temporarily).
* `make` to do all the above.

For test coverage report using bisect_ppx, type
*  `make test-coverage` (report in `./_coverage/index.html`)

For extracting (haddock-style) documentation from the code using dune, type
*  `make docs` (docs entrypoint: `./_build/default/_doc/_html/index.html`)

## Local Deployment

TODO: Add instructions here about how to patch `tezos-client`, how to run a sandbox, how to deploy the contract, and how to call it.
