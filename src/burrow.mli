(** Check whether a burrow is overburrowed. A burrow is overburrowed if
  *
  *   tez_collateral < fminting * kit_outstanding * minting_price
  *
  * The quantity tez_collateral / (fminting * minting_price) we call the burrowing
  * limit (normally kit_outstanding <= burrowing_limit).

(** Check whether a burrow can be marked for liquidation. A burrow can be
  * marked for liquidation if:
  *
  *   tez_collateral < fliquidation * kit_outstanding * liquidation_price
  *
  * The quantity tez_collateral / (fliquidation * liquidation_price) we call the
  * liquidation limit. Note that for this check we optimistically take into
  * account the expected kit from pending auctions (using the current minting
  * price) when computing the outstanding kit. Note that only active burrows
  * can be liquidated; inactive ones are dormant, until either all pending
  * auctions finish or if their creation deposit is restored. *)

(** Perform housekeeping tasks on the burrow. This includes:
  * - Updating the outstanding kit to reflect accrued burrow fees and imbalance adjustment.
  * - Update the last observed adjustment index
  * - Update the last observed timestamp.
  * - Rebalance outstanding_kit/excess_kit
  * - NOTE: Are there any other tasks to put in this list?

val burrow_touch : parameters -> burrow -> burrow

(** Deposit the kit earnings from the liquidation of a slice into the burrow.
  * That is, (a) update the outstanding kit, and (b) adjust the burrow's
  * pointers to the liquidation queue accordingly (which is a no-op if we are
  * not deleting the youngest or the oldest liquidation slice). *)

(** Cancel the liquidation of a slice. That is, (a) return the tez that is part
  * of a liquidation slice back to the burrow and (b) adjust the burrow's
  * pointers to the liquidation queue accordingly (which is a no-op if we are
  * not deleting the youngest or the oldest liquidation slice). *)

  * is less than the creation deposit. *)

(** Mint a non-negative amount of kit from the burrow, as long as this will
  * not overburrow it *)

(** Deposit/burn a non-negative amount of kit to the burrow. If there is
  * excess kit, simply store it into the burrow. *)

(** Activate a currently inactive burrow. This operation will fail if either
  * the burrow is already active, or if the amount of tez given is less than
  * the creation deposit. *)

(** Deativate a currently active burrow. This operation will fail if the burrow
  * (a) is already inactive, or (b) is overburrowed, or (c) has kit
  * outstanding, or (d) has collateral sent off to auctions. *)
